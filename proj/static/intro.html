 Dr. Yunjie Zhao received his PhD degree in 2012 from Huazhong University of Science & Technology, Wuhan, China, under the
supervision of Prof. Yi Xiao and have since been a Research Scientist in Department of Physics at the George Washington University.
His doctoral research was about computational studies on the structure and dynamics of non-coding RNA. He developed automated
and efficient nucleic acid structure modeling (3dRNA, Scientific Reports, 2012) and evaluation (3dRNAscore, Nucleic Acids
Research, 2015) programs. As a fellow in the newly established Center of Biomolecular Sciences at George Washington University,
his work centers on understanding the mechanisms of biomolecular regulations including STAT3 (Transcription, 2013), drug
design (PloS one, 2014), and MID1 proteins (PloS one, 2015) that are involved in programmable cell death and birth defects,
respectively. In short, the research program integrates molecular modeling, MD simulation, and dynamical network analysis
to tackle the human diseases at molecular level.
